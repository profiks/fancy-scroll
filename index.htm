			<p>Blog.SpoonGraphics is my main design blog, which I'm probably most known for. What was started in April 2007 as a simple playground for me to post my design experiments has now become a highly trafficked spot on the web for design tips and tutorials with daily traffic and subscriber stats in the tens of thousands.<br/>
		If you're wanting to learn Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, or if you’re just interested in checking out some of my design work head over there and have a browse. </p>

			<p>Line25 is my second design related blog. Blog.SpoonGraphics covers the topics of illustration and general design, whereas Line25 has a specific focus on Web Design. Despite being a couple of years younger than my SpoonGraphics blog, it has already surpassed its number of RSS subscribers. Stop by and subscribe for weekly doses of web design inspiration and tutorials.</p>
